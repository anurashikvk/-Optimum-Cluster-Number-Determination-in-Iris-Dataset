# Optimum Cluster Number Determination in Iris Dataset

## Introduction
This project aims to determine the optimum number of clusters in the famous Iris dataset using K-Means Clustering algorithms.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, containing 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is commonly used for testing clustering algorithms due to its simplicity and clear class separation.

## Algorithms Used
1. K-Means Clustering
